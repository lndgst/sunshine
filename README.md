This repo contains a simple webpage that visualizes hourly direct solar radiation in San Francisco using the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API.

Open `index.html` in your browser to see a dot matrix of the radiation forecast for all of 2025. Each row corresponds to a day and each column to an hour of the day. The dots fade from transparent to opaque based on the radiation level.
