This repo contains a simple webpage that visualizes hourly direct solar radiation in San Francisco using the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API.

Open `index.html` in your browser to see a dot matrix of the hourly direct radiation for the last 92 days plus tomorrow. Each row represents a day and each column an hour. The dots fade from transparent to opaque based on the radiation level.
